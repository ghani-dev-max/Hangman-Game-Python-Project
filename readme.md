# Hangman Game – Python Project

🎮 **Project Overview**

This is a console-based Hangman game built in Python. The player guesses letters of a secret word chosen from a story. The game tracks correct and wrong guesses, provides feedback, and allows multiple rounds with scoring.

## 📝 **Story Theme**

The words are taken from a short story about Harun, a clockmaker in a mountain village. The story teaches the value of time and patience.

## 📜 **Rules**

1. A secret word will be chosen randomly from the story.
2. The player guesses the word **one letter at a time**.
3. You have **5 wrong attempts** for each round.
4. If you guess all letters before running out of attempts, you win the round.
5. The game can continue for multiple rounds, and the score is tracked.

## ⚙️ **How to Play**

1. Run the Python script in any Python environment (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Enter your name when prompted.
3. Guess letters one at a time.
4. After each round, your score will be displayed.
5. You can choose to play another round or exit the game.
